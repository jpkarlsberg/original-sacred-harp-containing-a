*Original Sacred Harp* retains the notation of this alto part in the bass clef from *The Sacred Harp* (1870). In this edition, however, the clef's key signature was altered from the appropriate placement in the 1870 edition to incorrectly match that of the the treble clefs of the song's treble and tenor lines. This change is not reflected in changing the clef or the placement of the notes in the staff.
