J. S. James refers readers to *Elson's Music Dictionary* (1905), the source of the preceding definition of what he mispells as "accoustic," as well as to *Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians* (1904–10). These two then-recently published texts were widely viewed as the reference works of record on musical concepts and musicians in the early twentieth century. Linking the rudiments of *Original Sacred Harp* to these texts exemplifies with James's mission of revising the text "to get at all material modern improvements" (vi). This marks a departure from *The Sacred Harp* (1844–70) rudiments, which drew extensively on the rudiments of previously published shape-note tunebooks but did not tether *The Sacred Harp* to definitions or publications associated with the urban centers of American music from which *Elson's* and *Grove's* emerged.
