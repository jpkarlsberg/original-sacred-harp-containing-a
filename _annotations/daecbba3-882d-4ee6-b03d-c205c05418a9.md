The rudiments in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) did not include sections on degrees of the scale or the letter names associated with staff positions. J. S. James drafted these sections for his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) in question and answer format, removing the questions in adapting the sections for *Original Sacred Harp*.
