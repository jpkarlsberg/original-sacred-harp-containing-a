J. S. James developed this table and the one at the bottom of the previous column depicting the durations of notes by condensing language from the rudiments of *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) and replacing British names for the notes (e.g. semibreve, minim, crotchet, quaver) with the newer American names (e.g. whole, half, quarter, eighth). This table is an adaptation of language James wrote in question and answer format for his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). James replaced a question in *Union Harp* with this title and moved the note heads, which had appeared in the middle of each line of text to the end, inserting the word "thus."
