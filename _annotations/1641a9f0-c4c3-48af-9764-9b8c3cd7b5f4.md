J. S. James adapted this description of the tonic and leading notes from his rudiments for *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). The section elaborates on the more concise description of these two scale degrees and the method for finding the major or minor tonic note from the leading note that appears just one page earlier in the *Original Sacred Harp* rudiments. This language builds on a brief discussion in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments on naming the notes for music "written in round notes entirely" by offering a similar method for finding the major or minor tonic in shape-note music.
