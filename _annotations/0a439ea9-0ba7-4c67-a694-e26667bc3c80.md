J. S. James's description of the relative lengths of notes is original, adapted from his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909), but it adopts a pedagogical approach and components of its language from a school of tunebooks published between 1839 and 1872. These books, beginning with Lowell Mason's 1839 *The Modern Psalmist* and including tunebooks edited by prominent compilers such as William B. Bradbury and George Frederick Root, adopted a self-consciously "constantly-progressive" approach to music pedagogy drawing on European models. James's affiliation with this approach to teaching rhythmics is notable because it represents a divergence from the approach taken in B. F. White's rudiments in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70); perhaps another component of James's "attempt to get at all material modern improvements" (vi).
