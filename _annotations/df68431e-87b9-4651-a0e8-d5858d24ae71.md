In addition to including a table depicting the relative durations of notes elsewhere on this page James also includes a much closer adaptation of the table on the same subject that appeared in *The Sacred Harp (1844â€“70), largely retaining B. F. White's language and the staff positions of notes both here and in James's *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). James diverges from *The Sacred Harp* and his own *Union Harp* in selecting new staff positions for the examples of semiquavers and demisemiquavers.
