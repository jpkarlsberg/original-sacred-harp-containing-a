J. S. James adapted this description of the leading note and key note, major and minor music, and the different harmony parts in Sacred Harp singing, from a version in question and answer format in *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). The *Original Sacred Harp* version also omits section titles separating components of the text on different subjects. Portions of its content roughly overlap with language in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments on "the diatonic scale" that discusses major and minor keys. James addresses this same topic in greater depth on the following page.
