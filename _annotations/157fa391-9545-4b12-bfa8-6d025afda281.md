J. S. James's description of methods associated with "four shaped notes" retains the prescription to use "Down and Up" motions for common and compound time described in the nineteenth-century rudiments. New to this edition is James's description of methods of beating common and compound time with "four beats" or "as many as 'Six Beats' to the measure" respectively that involve leftward and rightward as well as downward and upward motions.
