This suggestion of praticing common intervals using a table of numbers is new to the rudiments. J. S. James adapted it from a section that, like the extended discussion of "beating times" elsewhere on this page, was "overlooked" in typesetting the *Union Harp and History of Songs* rudiments and appended to the end. This approach to interval practice is new to the rudiments, although *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments did recommend teaching "the sound, the name, and the number of each note, from 1 to 8."
