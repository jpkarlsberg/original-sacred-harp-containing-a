J. S. James followed *The Sacred Harp* (1844–70) rudiments in beginning his list of shape-notes and their names with the leading note rather than the tonic. This understanding of "Mi" as "the leading note [that] governs the other three" is a retention of an English way of thinking about the scale dating back to the sixteenth century. In describing the seven-note and round-note scales, James instead begins with the tonic "Do" and proceeds up the major scale.

James retains the spelling of “Faw" from *The Sacred Harp*’s nineteenth-century rudiments even though he spells the note “Fa” in the seven-note scale. He adopts the conventional spellings of “La” and “Mi” for both the four- and seven-note scales, departing from previous rudiments, which adopted spellings, “Law” and “Me,” corresponding with the notes’ pronunciation.
