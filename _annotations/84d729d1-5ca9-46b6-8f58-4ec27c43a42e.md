J. S. James retained this diagram, which appears in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments, although he eliminated a second staff illustrating two bar, four bar, and eight bar rests. James also added a clef and double bar to the diagram. James included a similar diagram in his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909).
