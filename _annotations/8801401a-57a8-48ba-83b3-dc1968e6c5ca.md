J. S. James derived this question about the properties of musical tones associated with the departments of music without attribution from Henry Wellington Greatorex's ""A Short Catechism on the Elements of Music"" in his *A Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, Chants, Anthems, and Sentences* (1851), or perhaps from an unidentified intermediate source drawing on Greatorex. James adapted the text immediately following the portion of Greatorex's text James adapted for his definition of sound, which reads:

&gt; Q. What distinct properties has every pure musical tone?
&gt; A. It may be long or short, high or low, loud or soft."
