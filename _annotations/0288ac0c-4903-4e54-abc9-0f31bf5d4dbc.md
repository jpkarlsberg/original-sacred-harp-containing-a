J. S. James copied his definition of rhythmics without attribution from the *Elson’s Music Dictionary* (1905) by excerpting the text’s definition of “rhythm”: 

&gt; **Rhythm** (Eng.) … The division of musical ideas or sentences into regular metrical portions; musical accent and cadence as applied to melody. Rhythm represents the regular pulsation of music. The word *time* is constantly applied where *rhythm* is meant. ... (219–20)

James’s description of rhythm as related to time suggests he may have relied on Elson’s 1905 *Music Dictionary*, rather than his 1909 *Pocket Music Dictionary*, which also contains the passages James copied without attribution in his rudiments, but lacks a discussion of the appropriateness of “time,” “rhythm,” and “measure” as terms expressing the division of music into metrical portions. James may have drawn on this discussion in stating that rhythm “relates to all in music regarding time.”

Elson’s definition of rhythm was, itself, copied from an earlier source without attribution. William Smythe Babcock Mathews’s *Pronouncing Dictionary and Condensed Encyclopedia of Musical Terms, Instruments, Composers, and Important Works* (1880) defined in identical language:

&gt; The division of musical ideas or sentences into regular metrical portions; musical accent and cadence as applied to melody. (61)"
