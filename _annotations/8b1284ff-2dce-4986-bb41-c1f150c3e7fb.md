J. S. James replaced a section of *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments that describes the four-note names and their shapes and also discusses music set in round notes with this section on four- seven- and round-note shape-note systems adapted from a nearly identical section in *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) in question and answer format. James's inclusion of the seven-note systems speaks to the changed musical and social context in which *Original Sacred Harp* was published, where Sabbath School music published in seven notes was popular and a reader of the rudiments might wish to understand how the systems related. James foregrounds this approach in his "Introductory" statement in *Original Sacred Harp*'s frontmatter, declaring that the rudiments "are so fixed as to apply to any notation, it matters not whether in four and seven shape, or round notes" (vi).
