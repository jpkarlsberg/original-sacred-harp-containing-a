Musically, these two notes do not fit within the measure, but it is likely that the 7 (Me) and the 2 (Sol) to which it is tied were meant to be printed as eighth notes rather than quarter notes.

The 7 (Me) here is restored from the 1870 *Sacred Harp*, which was replaced in the 1909 *Union Harp* by the 2 (Sol). This edition includes both notes.
