*The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments described methods for beating time in its discussion of the "moods of time." In addition to retaining and adapting that section, J. S. James added new language that describes different methods of beating time depending on whether the music is set in four shapes versus and seven shapes or round notes. James combined and adapted two sections on "beating time" from *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) to create this section. The first paragraph draws on an overview of beating time on page 10 of *Union Harp*. The remaining language adapts a more extended discussion on page 45 that, *Union Harp* notes, "should have appeared in the lessons, but was overlooked."
