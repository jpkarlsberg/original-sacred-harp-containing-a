J. S. James reprinted this depiction of the major scale in four-shape-notes from his rudiments for *Union Harp and History of Songs*. This rendering replaced a discussion of the "notes ... used in music, ... their names, and how they [are] made" in *The Sacred Harp* rudiments (1844â€“70) which included a diagram of the four shape-notes in different durations with their syllables. *The Sacred Harp* rudiments also included a diagram of an octave of the scale starting and ending on the leading tone (me), accompanied by text instructing the singer to find "the governing and leading note," an echo of music pedagogy dating to the sixteenth-century replaced, in this edition, by a newer conception of the scale as starting and ending on the tonic.
