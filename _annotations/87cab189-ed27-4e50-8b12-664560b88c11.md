This section on the definition of rests and the durations of rests section covers material included in a similar section of *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments. B. F. White's rudiments appended this information to a comparable discusion of notes corresponding with material on page 3 in *Original Sacred Harp*. Yet in J. S. James's rudiments, it appears instead between two sections describing the names of notes in different notation systems. James adapted this definition of rests and description of the durations of rests from a similar section in *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) in question and answer format.
