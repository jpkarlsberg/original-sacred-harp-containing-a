No section on the musical staff appeared in *The Sacred Harp* rudiments (1844â€“70). J. S. James drafted this section of the "Rudiments of Music" in question and answer format for his *Union Harp and History of Songs*, removing the questions and making other slight adaptations for *Original Sacred Harp*.
