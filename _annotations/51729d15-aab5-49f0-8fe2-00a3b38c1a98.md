S. M. Denson copied this alto part from William Walker’s *The Christian Harmony* (57). He removed five choosing notes, four of them 7 (Sole) notes lower than the notes Denson chose to retain in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and tenth measures. Denson also removed a 7 (Si) from the fourth beat of the song’s tenth measure. He retained only the choosing notes at the end of the song.

The tune was written in three parts in the 1870 *Sacred Harp*.
