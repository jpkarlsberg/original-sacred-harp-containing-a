J. S. James copied his definition of vibration without attribution from the entry on vibration in the then-recently published *Elson's Musical Dictionary* (1905), shortening Elsonâ€™s entry slightly, perhaps for space or clarity. Elson's features the following definition:

&gt; **Vibration.** The tremulous or undulatory motion of any sonorous body (or of the air) by which the sound is produced, the sound being grave or acute, as the vibrations are fewer or more numerous in a given time. (280)
