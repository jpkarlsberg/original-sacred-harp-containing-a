This language on the interchangeability of shape-note and "round note" systems, which J. S. James reprinted from his rudiments for *Union Harp and History of Songs*, echoes similar language from *The Sacred Harp* rudiments (1844â€“70) that acknowledged that "some music books [contain] tunes written in round notes entirely" and described a method for determining the names of notes applicable to music regardless of notation system.
