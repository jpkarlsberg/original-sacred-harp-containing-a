J. S. James presents four staves of music per brace, each representing a different harmony part, as standard in his rewriting the rudiments' definition of the brace, a departure from comparable language in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70). B. F. White's rudiments in nineteenth-century editions of the tunebook stated in naming the staves of the brace "if but three parts, the third is Treble; but if the Counter is added, the fourth part is Treble, and the third, Counter." James's normalization of four staves per brace complements the decision to add alto parts to the *Original Sacred Harp* versions of all but 83 formerly three-part songs in *The Sacred Harp* (1870).
