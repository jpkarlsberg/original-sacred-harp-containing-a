The tune was written in three parts in the 1870 *Sacred Harp*.  The alto line is new to this edition.

S. M. Denson adapted this alto part from W. M. Cooper’s alto part in his *Sacred Harp* (31b). Denson made some alterations of his own, perhaps drawing on the song’s alto part in William Walker’s *The Christian Harmony* (21) for inspiration. 

Denson diverged from Cooper by selecting high 3 (La) half notes for the song’s first and third measures which also appear in *The Christian Harmony* alto part over lower notes in Cooper’s *Sacred Harp*. He modified Cooper’s second measure, replacing a pair of eighth notes in the fourth beat with a 2 (Sol) quarter note, perhaps to smooth the transition to the third measure. Denson also replaced a 4 (Fa) at the beginning of the fourth measure of Cooper’s alto part with a 3 (La), removing a discordant interval with the 3 (La) in the bass. The song’s final three measures are new to *Original Sacred Harp* and are in keeping with the part’s relatively high range, running above this section of the part in *The Christian Harmony* and Cooper’s *Sacred Harp*.
