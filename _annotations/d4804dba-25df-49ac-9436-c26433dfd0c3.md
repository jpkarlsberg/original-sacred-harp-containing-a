In adapting portions of his rudiments for *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) for *Original Sacred Harp*, J. S. James largely abandoned the numbered question and answer style of the *Union Harp* rudiments. Here James retained a question verbatim, including its number as the eighteenth question in the source text, introducing a noticeable break in the style of the *Original Sacred Harp* rudiments.
