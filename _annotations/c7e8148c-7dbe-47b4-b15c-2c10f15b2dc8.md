J. S. James added this section title to an adaptation of his writing on melody, sharps and flats, accent, and the modes of time from *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). In *Union Harp*, headings and questions separated the different topics treated in this portion of the rudiments. James omits the headings and questions and adapts language presented as answers in *Union Harp*. These changes introduce hard to follow transitions between discussions that appeared in more extended form in *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) as separate chapters, corresponding with the "departments of music" typically taught in singing schools.
