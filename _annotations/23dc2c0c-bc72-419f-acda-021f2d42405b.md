J. S. James also copied this definition of "accoustic" from *Elson's Musical Dictionary* (1905), quoting without attribution the first sentence of a page-long definition of "Acoustics" in the then-recently published source. The definition in Elson's begins:

&gt; **Acoustics** â€¦ The science of sound; the science treating of the laws of sound. (7)
