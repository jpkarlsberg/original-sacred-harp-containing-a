As a practicing lawyer and former judge of the inferior court of the northern district of Georgia, James was particularly well-placed to investigate the copyright status of Jesse B. Aikin's seven-note system. Historical evidence, however, suggests that Aikin did indeed obtain a patent for his system, leading other tunebook compilers in the nineteenth century to devise their own seven-note shape-note systems.
