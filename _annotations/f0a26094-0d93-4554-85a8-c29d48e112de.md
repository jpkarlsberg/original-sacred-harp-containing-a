*Original Sacred Harp*, like competing early-twentieth-century revisions by W. M. Cooper and J. L. White, retains the four-shape-note notation system that B. F. White adopted for the *Sacred Harp* in 1844 and retained in subsequent nineteenth-century editions. In this section of the rudiments, which J. S. James adapted from the rudiments in his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909), James alludes to seven-note as well as round-note notation and provides examples of the seven-shape-note system invented by Jesse B. Aikin in 1846 as well as the four-note system. James's inclusion of the competing systems and his acknowledgment that "all tones can be played or sung to four or seven notes, whether they be round or shaped" are new in acknowledging the existence of and describing the competing seven-shape-note system and conceding the systems' interchangeability.
