This language addressing the relationship between the four-shape-note and seven-shape-note naming schemes is new to the rudiments. J. S. James adapted it from *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909). The inclusion of this information speaks to the changed musical landscape surrounding use of *Original Sacred Harp*, in which singers were likely to have a background in singing from any of a range of seven-shape-note music books.
