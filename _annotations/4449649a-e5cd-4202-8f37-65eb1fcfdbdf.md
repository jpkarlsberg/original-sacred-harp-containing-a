Six pages into his rudiments. J. S. James appears to make a fresh start, titling this section lesson 1. James retained this unusual structure from his *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) rudiments, which turn to a sequence of lessons at the same point. In *Original Sacred Harp*, James introduces the title "Law of Sound" for this section.
