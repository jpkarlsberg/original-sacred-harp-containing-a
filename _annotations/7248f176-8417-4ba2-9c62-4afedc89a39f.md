S. M. Denson made modest alterations to an alto part by William Walker in *The Christian Harmony* (147) in deriving this alto line for “Fairfield.” Denson swapped the third and tenth measures of *The Christian Harmony* part note for note. In measure three, *Original Sacred Harp* has four quarter notes of 1 (La), whereas *The Christian Harmony* has 1 (Law), 7 (Sole), 5 (Mee), 7 (Sole). In the tenth measure, the parts are switched. 
Denson made one additional modification to the second measure of the alto part, replacing sharp and natural accidentals on the sequence of two 7 (Sole) quarter notes in *The Christian Harmony* with two (redundant) natural signs. Whether Denson decided the sharp 7 (Sol) was unfit for the music or whether the deviation from *The Christian Harmony* here is result of a printing error, the reliance on Walker’s alto part is clear.
	The editors of the 1936 *Original Sacred Harp: Denson Revision* modified the plate used to print the song in 1911, partially removing the redundant natural signs. They were removed completely when the tunebook was digitally retypeset for *The Sacred Harp: 1991 Edition*.
