J. S. James copied this definition of sound without attribution from James W. Moore's *Complete Encyclopaedia of Music*, first published in 1854 by leading Boston music publisher Oliver Ditson and reissued in 1880 with an appendix "introducing musical events to 1876." James drew from language midway through Moore's two-page definition of "Sound":

&gt; Sound is any thing and every thing hearable. It is noise, report, the object of hearing, that which strikes the ear; a vibration of the air, caused by a collision of bodies or other means, sufficient to effect the auditory nerves when perfect. â€¦ Sound is the noise produced by all vibrating bodies. (889)
