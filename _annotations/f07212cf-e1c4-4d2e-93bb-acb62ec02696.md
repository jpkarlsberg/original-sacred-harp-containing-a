J. S. James's question, "What is sound?" to begin this section on the "law of sound" mirrors the question "What is music" that started an early section of *The Sacred Harp* (1844â€“70) rudiments titled "Of Music." Both sections articulate a foundation on which the respective rudiments build a pedagogy of Sacred Harp singing. In shifting this foundation from "music" to "sound" James drew directly on three recent publications on music to further his presentation of *Original Sacred Harp* as a contemporary, systematically organized, text at home in booming New South Atlanta. James's definition of music as a type of sound rooted in the science of acoustics aligns with other features of *Original Sacred Harp*, such as its statistical "Summary Statement" and new printing plates, designed to carve out a space for the old *Sacred Harp* in the twentieth century.
